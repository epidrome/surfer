## Surf photography
The photos in this digital album stand for a rather small and non representative sample of surf and photography. In my experience as a photographer and as a surfer, I have found that the best moments are to be experienced with full engagement and almost zero gadgets. 

## Some notes on image gallery software
There is a lot of software available for managing image galleries. Of course, just like any piece of software, current digital photo albums make several assumptions that might not be suitable, depending on the requirements.

The specification I was looking for included:

* A style similar to Instagram, because people are creatures of habit, even when those habits are bad for them, especialy then!
* Git repository for the code, but not for the images.
* Flexibility to choose the web site theme and the image viewer library.

## Image files are stored in github issues
In this way, the git history remains clean of files that cannot be tracked and, at the same time, github issues provides social reactions and comments. Moreover, github issues provides notifications if you choose to watch the repository.

## Slow social features
It is nice to receive an email that is thoughtful and meaningful. You know, the kind of communication that once people used to have on paper mail, before email chat, attachments, notifications, newsletters, and spam. By the way of storing images in github issues, we get out of the box likes and comments. It is yet unclear, whether this is a bug, or a feature.

## Dependencies

* [Jekyll Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) is already flexible enough with skins, social media icons, and configuration files.
* [nanogallery](https://nanogallery2.nanostudio.org) has been implemented as a jekyll minima custom head and a jekyll layout.
